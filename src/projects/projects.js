    title: 'Two Factor Authentication',
    description: 'I successfully implemented a two-factor authentication feature in the authentication portal of the Social Security area of Sinqia and its mobile app. This development enhances the security of user accounts by requiring an additional verification step during the login process. By incorporating two-factor authentication, I have strengthened the overall security of the portal, reduced the risk of unauthorized access, and ensured compliance with industry best practices. This implementation showcases my commitment to delivering secure solutions and staying up-to-date with the latest security technologies. The two-factor authentication feature provides an added layer of defense, protecting sensitive data and instilling trust in the users of the authentication portal.',
